        This is just a learning project on how to use Python Package
        Index(PyPI).  Right now, I have implemented a sample module which will
        calculate sum of all natural numbers from 1 to n.
        
        This uses algorthm by: Carl Friedrich Guass[1777-1855, Germany]
        
        Typical usage::
        
            #!/usr/bin/env python
        
            from cg import german
            print german.sum(999)
