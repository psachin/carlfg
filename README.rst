This is just a learning project on how to use Python Package
Index(PyPI).  Right now, I have implemented a sample module which will
calculate sum of all natural numbers from 1 to n.

This uses algorthm by: Carl Friedrich Guass[1777-1855, Germany]

Typical usage::

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    from cg import german
    print german.sum(999)
